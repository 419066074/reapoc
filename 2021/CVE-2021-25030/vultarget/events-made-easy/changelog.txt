* The payment options tab is now an collapsed list op options per gateway, sos you can go faster to the gateway of choice

= 2.1.32 (2019/08/03) =

* Added featured image to rss feed
* Show event start date with local timezone in RSS feed if wanted (and not GMT)
* Add contact person paid emails format (next to the IPN format for the contact person)
* Documented the filter eme_csv_column_filter (allows you to change 1 CSV output line, so you can switch/remove/change columns). See the documentation on hooks and filters for an example.

* fix for discount groups with regular and early bird-combo (the reported discount codes used were not correct)
* Added a filter eme_ical_filter, which lets you influence each entry of an ical entry in the ical feed of events. It takes one parameter: the current ical-representation of a single event (matching your filters, based on the ical link you generated with [eme_ical_link]), so you can add/remove/change lines per entry.

= 2.1.28 (2019/07/11) =
* Correct CSV export of bookings if dynamic fields were included (export was on multiple lines in excel)
* Add warning in EME options page if the SEO permalink settings are conflicting with an existing page
* Added event placeholder #_ADDBOOKINGFORM_IF_LOGGED_IN, which shows the booking form only if logged in. The difference with requiring WP membership when defining the RSVP properties for an event is that in the latter case you can't change your personal info (it comes from your profile)

* Importing people now allows one or more group (or groups) columns. Each such column can contain either a group id or a groupsname (or multiple ids or names, separated by "||")
* In the RSVP form, you can now use #_COUNTRY{xx} (with "xx" being the code of a country created in EME, not the name). If used, that country will be selected as default in the form.
* For a required formfield of type checkbox with multiple values, the html rendered required all values to be checked. Now only one needs to be checked.
* ical fixes (events are exported in gmt now, and added the organizer field)
* New excerpt functionality:
  - if "<!--more-->" is present in the event notes, #_EXCERPT will take the part before this seperator, and #_NOEXCERPT the part after it
  - if "<!--more-->" is not present, #_EXCERPT will take the first 55 characters by default (filter eme_excerpt_length can be used to change this), #_NOEXCERPT will be the complete text

= 2.1.26 (2019/06/14) =
* Make eme_attendees and #_ATTENDEES work again (error in sql statement)

= 2.1.20 (2019/05/04) =
* Make sure the paypal payment works for production sites

= 2.1.19 (2019/05/04) =
* Fix a PHP warning for memberships and number of function arguments

= 2.1.18 (2019/05/03) =
* Add an option that influences whether or not a list of events should be shown on the default special events page.
  This complements the option to show a calendar on the default special events page.
  It is recommended to leave this option off and use placeholders on regular wordpress pages instead.
* Custom fields of type "People field" can now be included in the CSV export for bookings
  This can be set in the definition of the custom field.
* Mollie notification can arrive later than the return page shown, resulting in an wrong message shown of the payment not being paid
  Now we store the mollie payment id generated with the EME payment, so we can check in the return page the result too
* Image url in the db was stored as relative url. Although the image id takes precedence, it is cleaner to store the url as is too.
  Also the image placeholders (for events, people) now have a full url (so they work correctly in mails too)
* Add a parseFloat conversion in the javascript for single map locations, to make sure javascript recognizes the coordinates as floating point and not text
* In the location map, the popup was not sized correctly if an image was included, due to the image size not being known yet. JS code has been added to rectify that.
* Update to new v2-API for PayPal payments (v1 is in the process of being deprecated by PayPal)
  While webhooks don't work, it should be fine. Bugs in the API or the way PayPal shows info (in the sandbox the amount and description are not shown to the buyer)
  will hopefully get fixed by PayPal.
* Legacy paypal IPN works again

* For bookings and attendees: the person-related placeholders should now start with #_PERSONxxx (and not with #_RESP or #_ATTEND anymore for the placeholders that hold person info)
* #_INVITEURL and #_INVITEURL{xx} can now be used in mails towards people (in case the mail is event-related #_INVITEURL will take the event id of the related event,
  otherwise #_INVITEURL{xx} should be used with 'xx' being the id or name of the event)
  These 2 can send out an invite url to people concerning an event. In case the event is then marked as invite-only, only the people that received such a mail can rsvp once.
* Added a new event placeholder #_IS_INVITE_ONLY (can be used in a eme_if-condition to show some other content if the event is invitation-only)
* CSS fix for the small calendar widget month name (it was not centered anymore)

= 2.1.13 (2019/03/28) =

* Fix for rsvp start/end conditions
* Added extra discount conditions: now you can require users to be logged-in for the discount to apply, or to be a part of an EME group or membership or have a certain WP role

= 2.1.10 (2019/03/05) =
* Add an option (in the "Other" section) where you can add extra html tags and attributes to be allowed for html content in eme settings (like templates)
* Add an option (in the "Events" section) that allows to specify a redirect url if a person not logged-in tries to view a private event (by default redirect to wp login page is done)

  See [this page](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/integration/admin/manage-apps/#overview) for more info and guidelines.

* RSVP full message can now also be changed in the backend
* Disable (or try to) autocomplete for RSVP password protection

* Document the use of #_ATTENDANCE_QRCODE ==> #_ATTENDANCE_QRCODE can only be used in the pdf template for tickets or membership cards
  If any other php lib is loaded providing the same qrcode class, the qrcode will refuse to load, so then you'll need to use a shortcode provided by the other
  plugin to create the qrcode based on the value of #_ATTENDANCE_URL
* Allow event/location/people properties (see functions eme_init_event_props, eme_init_location_props, eme_init_person_props) to be imported too
* Fix a show_recurrent_events_once sql bug (in fact not a bug, but indeterministic result) due to newer mysql/mariadb versions

* Small js fix for admin backend and location custom pin (it was not resized correctly there)
* Add an option to use gesture handling for maps (if you choose to use map gestures, then on a desktop zooming must be done using ctrl+zoom, and on a mobile device the user needs to use two fingers to pan the map. This to prevent getting "trapped" in the map when a big map is shown).
* Fix required custom fields in the rsvp form
* Fix multiline customfields with empty first value

= 2.0.75 (2018/12/15) =

* Added #_FIELD{xx} to the eme_filterform too, so you can add a custom field to the search parameters

  Using these filters (eme_admin_field_value_filter is applied only in the admin backend, eme_field_value_filter only in the frontend), you can change the value
  of certain form fields by looking up other info from other tables/posts and based on the formfield, the userid, ...
* Make event and location imports work (csv only currently)
* Membership payment logic is now unified (for pending,active,expired and grace status), so you no longer need to check the membership status in order to choose the correct action

* Fix rights management for deleting your own event

* In the people admin screen, you can now also filter on memberships and membership status
* Fix typo in RSVP database query

= 2.0.60 (2018/10/27) =
* Fix CSV export and booking list

= 2.0.59 (2018/10/26) =
* Add notion of Trash to bookings too (when cancel happens, the booking is moved to trash so it can be restored when needed)
* Deprecated eme_delete_booking_form_filter in favor of eme_cancel_booking_form_filter
* Deprecated #_DELBOOKINGFORM in favor of #_CANCELBOOKINGFORM
* Scroll down to booking message also in the case the payment form is shown
* Mollie changes (API update and GET=>POST)
* Return formatted string for #_TRANSFER_NBR_BE97
* Added scopes today--future (showing events from today onwards, the original behavior for the scope 'future') and now--today (showing events from now till the end of the day)
  The old scope 'future' now takes the event time into account as well, as does the scope 'past'
  The old behavior of 'past' (which showed events until yesterday), is now called 'past--yesterday'
* Fix for storing dynamic data with events (typo fix)

= 2.0.58 (2018/10/13) =
* Captcha fallback if no freetype support is compiled in your PHP GD library
* Option to set the use of a captcha per event or membership
* Captcha is now always case-insensitive, so the corresponding option for that is removed
* Correctly replace #_ADDBOOKINGFORM_IF_USER_HAS_CAP{xx} and #_USER_HAS_CAP{xxx} if user is not logged in too (idem with the similar MEMBER_OF and IN_GROUP placeholders)
* Fix the detection of required fields when using the form #REQ_FIELD{fieldname}
* Make sure the image property for the person is saved upon add/edit of a person
* If the total amount of seats=0 (unlimited), then obey the set max for number of seats to book
* Make sure the datefield is empty and not the current date when it should be empty

= 2.0.57 (2018/10/04) =
* Fix for editing recurrent events on specific days (the check for end date is not needed in that case and was blocking the edit)
* Fix for storing custom answers (they were stored, but deletedd immediately after)

= 2.0.56 (2018/10/02) =
* Small improvement for event and location featured image (a little bit of text was shown too much in the add/edit screens)
* Small improvement in member start/end date calculations for new members when defined in the backend (made it more logical)
* Fix new location being added through event add

= 2.0.55 (2018/10/02) =
* Add grace period for memberships, to allow people to remain member for a number of days after the end date has passed
* Add "one extra free period" for memberships. This is mostly for the fixed period membership type, where people "jump" in the middle of a current membership period but still need to pay the full price. This option then allows them to receive 1 extra membership period for free. Example: someone becomes a member for 1 year (membership starts in Jan) in June, he would need to pay full price but only receives six months (till Dec). So either you calculate pro-rata the price for him (not possible automatically yet), or you give 1 year free (so it would end Dec + 1 year)
* Added API function eme_get_booking_post_answers, this allows people to easily get the POST answers for a booking for e.g. own discounts
* Fix showing draft events (when paging event listings or in the calendar)
* Fix for updating old version of EME to latest (argument count was wrong for function eme_get_mailings in the upgrade procedure)

= 2.0.54 (2018/09/23) =
* The captcha will now return an error if the wordpress configured temp dir is not writable
* The captcha was removed if correctly entered, but other form validations might fail later on, so we take care of that now and not invalidate the captcha until the whole validation is ok
* Added event placeholders #_ADDBOOKINGFORM_IF_USER_HAS_CAP{xx} (shows the booking form if user has a certain WP capability) and #__USER_HAS_CAP{xxx} (usefull as conditional tag check)
* Avoid double "Required field" messages
* Fix a setting logic so you can still rsvp after the start of an event if configured so
* When editing a recurrence with 'Specific Days', only 1 day was shown
* Add a missing html div-tag to the eme calendar

= 2.0.53 (2018/09/15) =
* SECURITY RELEASE
  Please update to this release if using the client clock functionality and EME version>2.0.48
  Info: the cookie is now stored using json_encode and not serialize, to avoid for Object Injection
  See https://www.owasp.org/index.php/PHP_Object_Injection
  Reported by pluginvulnerabilities.com (Thank you guys!)

= 2.0.52 (2018/09/13) =
* Fix #_EDITEVENTLINK and #_EDITEVENTURL (had wrong nonce)
* Fix a double escaping in the location marker balloon format (resulted in double links and maybe not all image showed in the balloon)
* Fix showing the list of uploaded files in the edit-booking window

= 2.0.51 (2018/09/11) =
* Fix map balloon format
* Remove a double function call

= 2.0.50 (2018/09/10) =

* Fix mail error message after rsvp
* Fix massmail popup dialog

= 2.0.47 (2018/09/03) =
* Fix mail sending and error reporting in the admin backend

= 2.0.46 (2018/09/02) =
* Allow file upload fields.
  This causes all forms to require a reasonably new browser, but already tested on: IE11 (Edge should be ok too), Firefox and Chrome (also Android versions)
  The field upload can also be done for persons in the backend (if defined as a dynamic field)
* #_FILES can be called for bookings and members, returning the files uploaded for that booking or member (all files uploaded!). However: a custom field that was
  marked as "Person field" (so asking for personal info) will not be returned when using #_FILES
* #_PERSONAL_FILES can be called bookings and members, returning the files uploaded for the relevant person
* Show smtp debugging only when sending a test email
* Implement an optional limit on the datetime people can start using the rsvp form ("Allow RSVP from" setting per event, complementing the "Allow RSVP until" setting) 
* When editing a booking and the price of the event changed in the meantime, take the new price into account and show a warning
* Activate ignore_filter in the calendar shortcode (option was documented but not activated)
* Marker clustering is now possible again too (it was on google maps, now also on openstreetmap)
* Bugfix for multiple maps on one page
* Bugfix when moving a booking from one event to another (the data was lost)

= 2.0.45 (2018/08/25) =
* Simple bugfix release

= 2.0.44 (2018/08/25) =
* Moved from Google Maps to OpenStreetMap since the Google Maps service now requires a credit card etc ...
  This helps me in deciding not to try and integrate Google products anymore (not even recaptcha)
  Because of this, the #_ADD_DIRECTIONS_FORM currently will not return a form anymore (might become a map later on)
* Revamped some recurrence code
* Bugfix: when looking at a single location in the frontent, a 404 was returned
* Bugfix: default page template was not selected for new events

= 2.0.43 (2018/08/24) =
* Added booking placeholders #_DISCOUNTCODES_ENTERED and #_DISCOUNTCODES_VALID (or #_DISCOUNTCODES_USED) to show the discount codes someone entered and those that are valid (the used ones)
* Allow a different wordpress page template to be used per event (like any other wordpress pages)
* Fix so #_MAPS returns empty and not a warning if you don't have Google Maps activated
* Bugfix when reusing a mail (html code was not escaped correctly)

= 2.0.42 (2018/08/21) =
* Formfields of type 'people' are now stored per person, so you can ask for extra personal info during rsvp or membership signup
* Autocomplete now also works for the membership form
* Bugfix for massmail popup dialog (it popped up on the wrong condition)
* Bugfix when trashing a person (memberships and groups were not removed)

= 2.0.41 (2018/08/19) =
* Added separate view for mail archive
* Implemented people trash and restore, together with an option to simply remove personal data (like the wordpress request for removal does)
* The unsubscribe form shortcode eme_unsubform now takes 1 argument: template_id. This template can use the following placeholders: #_EMAIL, #_MAILGROUPS, #_GDPR (or #_GDPR{xxx}), and #_SUBMIT (or #_SUBMIT{xx}). If you want your own form for unsbscribe, use this on a page and not #_UNSUB_URL

= 2.0.40 (2018/08/17) =
* Re-added the default setting for massmail for new persons
* Option added to show a popup if a person selects 'No' for #_OPT_IN or #_OPT_OUT. This allows to ask the person if they are sure that they don't want to receive mails
* GDPR removal of a person keeps the person id, but removes all user info in it. This allows booking counts for events to stay correct.
* In the events overview you can now filter on start or end date, or both (in which case it is a range for events starting on or later than the first selected date and ending on or before the second selected date)
* The subscribe form shortcode eme_subform now takes 1 argument: template_id. This template can use the following placeholders: #_EMAIL, #_MAILGROUPS, #_GDPR (or #_GDPR{xxx}), and #_SUBMIT (or #_SUBMIT{xx})

= 2.0.39 (2018/08/16) =
* Removed the default setting for massmail for new persons. This setting was not GDPR compliant. If you want to know if a person wants massmailing or not, use the #_OPT_IN or #_OPT_OUT placeholders in your form (and #_OPT_OUT is not GDPR compliant as well)
* Added a popup if a person doesn't want massmailing, to ask them to be sure
* Bugfix for disabling the honeypot field
* JS bugfix if gmap is not enabled or API key not defined

= 2.0.38 (2018/08/15) =
* Added the option to require a password for rsvp submit, together with a new rsvp form placeholder #_PASSWORD
* Groups can now be designated for "mail only", and then people can unsubscribe from those groups in the new subscribe/unsubscribe form
* Added [eme_subform] and [eme_unsubform] shortcodes, so people can subscribe/unsubcribe to email groups
* Added placeholders #_EVENTS_COUNT and #_EVENT_COUNTER for eme_events shortcode. This gets interpreted for the templates and results in the count of events shown in the list (#_EVENTS_COUNT) or the position of the event in the list (#_EVENT_COUNTER)
  These can then be used in conditional tags to create dynamic templates based on the position or the amount of events
* Most booking placeholders concerning people no longer need "RESP" in them, meaning you can almost literally copy the rsvp form format to the mail format and the resulting mail should reflect the expected result
* Added placeholder #_GDPR for forms, shows just a checkbox that needs to be ticked, otherwise the form will not submit. Extra explanation is yours to add of course.
  Also added #_GDPR{xxx} where xxx is an extra label text for the checkbox
* All rsvp related placeholders for events now use the linked event for rsvp info (some were missing)
* Since the google maps api key is now required, don't show the map anymore if not so, but show a warning
* Add a generic option to disable the hidden honeypot field
* Attempt to disable caching for the captcha image by some caching plugins
* Bugfix for attendance url

= 2.0.37 (2018/07/31) =
* Added option template_id_no_events to [eme_events]
* New rsvp placeholder #_ATTENDANCE_URL, will allow you to create an url (and using any other wp plugin create a qr-code), to send to the booker. When entering, this is scanned and checked:
 - if it is paid for
 - if the number of times this link is used is not higher than the amount of seats
 - only valid 5 hours before the event starts and until the event is finished (these limits can be set per event)
* Added conditional tags #_IS_ENDED_EVENT, #_IS_USER_IN_GROUP{xxx} and #_IS_USER_MEMBER_OF{xxx}
* Added #_ADDBOOKINGFORM_IF_USER_IN_GROUP{xxx} and #_ADDBOOKINGFORM_IF_USER_IS_MEMBER_OF{xxx}
* Allow RSVP from one event to be linked to the RSVP section of another event
* Several email subject formats can now also be customized per event
* Moved the setting concerning the "required field text" for form fields to the section "Other", because it also applies to membership forms and not just rsvp forms
* Fix when editing personal info for an existing booking, together with autocomplete fix
* Bugfix: mail to all active members of specific memberships was not working

= 2.0.36 (2018/06/26) =
* When showing a calendar day with only 1 event: redirect to that event, solves title issues
* remove an old code fragment that did php output buffering
* Added action eme_approve_rsvp_action, executed immediately after booking approval. 1 parameter: $booking (contains all info of the booking in an array)
* Send an approval mail if total price to pay is 0 (due to discount or so) and auto-approve is set
* Added an option to add events and locations to the link search when creating links in the wordpress editor
* Correctly show the payment form for memberships too

= 2.0.35 (2018/05/28) =

* Bugfix when storing person info after editing a booking in the backend

= 2.0.33 (2018/05/22) =
* EME is now compatible with the new gdpr functionality of wordpress, but not everybody is willing to update their WP version, so this version takes that into account

= 2.0.32 (2018/05/21) =
* Fix a bordercase with dynamic data where you use the same custom fields both in the main RSVP form and in the dynamic fields section
* Documented the eme_people shortcode
* Added options template_id_header and template_id_footer to the eme_people shortcode
* Added #_GROUPS to attendee, booking and people placeholders, returning a csv list of the groups a person is in
* Added #_GROUPS to dynamic data condition placeholders for events and memberships, returning a csv list of groups a user that is entering a form is currently in
* Added eme_if condition 'incsv', so for ex. you can compare if a certain person is in a certain group and based on that show/hide stuff
* Added extra dynamic data conditions (like 'contains', 'notcontains' and 'incsv')
* Make EME compliant with the new wordpress gdpr functions

= 2.0.31 (2018/05/07) =
* Revert the global use of Nuberformatter, not every php installation has the intl extensions loaded (even though it is available in cpanel etc ...)

= 2.0.30 (2018/05/04) =

* Allow sending a preview mail for event mails
* Add payment gateway and transaction ID info to booking/member payment info
* Improve FirstData payments (other currencies except USD accepted now)
* Add filter eme_add_currency_codes to be able to define the 4217 numeric code for own currencies (next to eme_add_currencies filter)

* NumberFormatter is now a requirement. This is not an issue for any php version >=5.6, which is required anyway.

* Fix for editing a booking with dynamic fields
* Show dropdown field tag values too for a formfield of type 'Person'
* Fix dynamic pricing for custom fields again
* Add EME version number to all javascript files, solves caching issues

* Allow javascript to be used in the "booking recorded message"
* Add an option to stay on the edit page after saving an event

= 2.0.27 (2018/04/09) =
* Add an option to exclude registered people from event mailings
* Added creation_date and modif_date columns to virtual every eme table (and removed the unused *_gmt columns)
* Review #_EVENTFIELD{xx}, #_LOCATIONFIELD{xx}, #_PERSONFIELD{xx}, #_BOOKINGFIELD{xx} and #_ATTENDFIELD{xx} with 'xx' being the name of a field for events, locations, persons, bookings or attendees. With the newly (or existing) columns for creation/modif you can use these placeholders for creation/modif timings

= 2.0.26 (2018/03/27) =
* Database table definition fixes for new installations
* Fix for an option that was not saved
* Show the format settings for rsvp payment success/failure (they were hidden in the options by old javascript)
* Fix for the case where only 1 country is defined and #_COUNTRY is not used in the rsvp form (in which case #_STATE should return the states for that 1 country)

= 2.0.25 (2018/03/26) =
* Planned mailings now get their conditions reevaluated before the mailing starts (groups and such) so the result of the mailing will be as close to reality as possible on that moment
  This change is kindly sponsored by Alex Floris
* Cancelled mailings had wrong statistics (reported 0 cancelled), this has been fixed
* Added event placeholders #_STARTDATE{xx}, #_ENDDATE{xx}, #_EVENTCREATIONDATE{xx}, #_EVENTMODIFDATE{xx} with 'xx' being the date format of your liking (php date format compatible)

* Discount code fixes when showing/editing dynamic prices in the admin backend
* Deleting a person when deleting a member was not working as expected

* Bugfix for taking into account WP membership and "register only once"

  In crontab: */5 * * * * php -q /path/to/wordpress/wp-cron.php >/dev/null 2>&1
  And in wp-config.php: define('DISABLE_WP_CRON', true);

* Another discount fix (for dynamic price calc)
* Added creation/modif datetime columns for events in the admin backend

* The displayed start/end date for new members was not correct when signing them up in the backend interface

= 2.0.6 (2017/11/13) =

  For this #_IS_ADMIN and #_IS_LOGGED_IN now work in member forms
* Better handling of answers (update when needed), to alleviate the pressure on the answers table
* Integrate better with wordpress images, so:
  - for people, we can use #_IMAGETITLE, #_IMAGEDESCRIPTION, #_IMAGEALT, #_IMAGECAPTION (the 4 properties you can set for a wordpress image)

= 2.0.5 (2017/11/12) =
* Show more error messages on screen to catch php issues for people ...

* Removing a person from the last group he was in was not working
* Removed the option "Add payment id to return page info" (added by default now) and as a result simplified the code for custom return/error pages for bookings (works for multi-bookings too now)
* Small interface fix for the membership and forever-period (to show an empty end-date and not the date of today)

= 2.0.4 (2017/11/10) =

* Rename comment fields so that some plugins don't intercept it anymore (like antispambee does)

* Fix a function call so it also works with older (unsupported) php versions

* Render initial map for edit-events correctly again
* The placeholders #_EVENTPRICE, #_TOTALPRICE, #_CHARGE, #_TOTALDISCOUNT, #_BOOKINGPRICEPERSEAT, #_DYNAMICPRICE (which were already showing the localised price layout) now also show the currency symbol if the NumberFormatter php class is present (which is the case in all newer php versions).
  An option is created to deactivate this behavior if you don't like it.
  *** It might be needed to change your templates accordingly to not show multiple times the same currency symbol ***
* Add #_CURRENCYSYMBOL as placeholder to show the symbol if you need it specifically. This option only works if the php class NumberFormatter is present, which is the case in all newer php versions.
* If possible, show the currency symbol in booking table, csv and printable outputs and for mails (when using price-related placeholders). Again, see above: this option can be deactivated.
* The placeholder #_RECURRENCE_DESC now returns a list of comma-separated days in the frontend

= 1.8.0 (2017/04/23) =
* Fix for eme_events month scope ranges

* Stripe payments were twice multiplied by 100, this is fixed now, together with other stripe fixes
* Make sure the example locations are created correctly for new installations
* Improvement: the 'No events' message now also has a span and not a div surrounding it, with id 'events-no-events'. Reason: div could interfere with the surrounding layout (if inside a p-tag for example)
* Waiting list feature implemented, together with some extra placeholders for events (#_WAITING_LIST_ACTIVATED and #_WAITINGLISTSEATS) and for the RSVP mails (#_ON_WAITINGLIST), see the doc
* Now one can indicate that RSVP formfields can influence the total price, this allows you to create for example "donation fields"

= 1.7.18 (2017/03/28) =
* Entered custom field values were not correctly shown when editing a booking

* In mails, add newlines carefully, to not disrupt possible html layout
* Custom field values were empty in the mails

= 1.7.16 (2017/03/26) =
* BUGFIX BUGFIX BUGFIX!!!
* People that use custom answer fields and already updated to 1.7.15 should either:
  * revert to a backup of their database for 1.7.14 and update to 1.7.16, or:
  * revert to a backup for their answers table (from before 1.7.15) and execute the following query afterwards:
  ALTER TABLE wp_eme_answers add field_id INT(11) DEFAULT 0;
  UPDATE wp_eme_answers SET field_id = (select field_id from wp_eme_formfields where field_name = wp_eme_answers.field_name LIMIT 1);
  ALTER TABLE wp_eme_answers DROP COLUMN 'field_name';
  (and check if the newly created column field_id contains the correct field id numbers)

(The second method is less intrusive but requires a bit more manual work) 
You can check if you're impacted by looking at your wp_eme_answers table in mysql and see if the column field_id contains any NULL values

= 1.7.15 (2017/03/24) =
* Support zero-decimal currencies in Stripe (like JPY)
* Prevent html-chars for text stuff in rsvp placeholders (again)
* Widget used a unchecked calendar_day variable in a date string (it couldn't hurt, but attackers try everything and it is not pretty in logfiles)
* Show "my bookings" more consistently for logged in users
* Better html-editor usage
* Removing a custom field will also delete the RSVP answers linked to that field (if any)
* Since Google Maps require an API key, maps are no longer attempted to be shown if no API key is entered
* Even more rigurous javascript/html removal from rsvp form input. I already removed all html-tags, but sometimes it might not be enough (no XSS known here, but one never knows)
* Better error message if a new recurrence contains no events
* Allow to put a registration back in pending state
* Bugfix: when sending mails concerning unpaid bookings, all bookings were mailed (not just the unpaid ones) 
* Bugfix: location dropdown select was not showing the map anymore
* Workaround: wordpress allows wrongly encoded chars to pass in their db-functions, so I'm cleaning these out now (useful for e.g. facebook syncs, that also can pass wrongly encoded chars)
* Renamed the admin page events-manager to eme-manager

= 1.7.14 (2017/03/02) =
* Fix cal header days

= 1.7.13 (2017/03/02) =

* Better edit for existing events/locations
* Allow to filter by date in the backend for events and bookings

= 1.7.12 (2017/02/14) =
* Dutch language updates (thanks to Benny De Vuyst)
* The location placeholders #_PASTEVENTS, #_NEXTEVENTS, #_ALLEVENTS now have an optional parameter so you can decide the sorting order
  of the events shown. Default is ASC, so e.g.:
  #_PASTEVENTS{ASC}
  #_NEXTEVENTS{DESC}
  More complex ordering can be used too, see the eme_events shortcode for tips
* Allow the status of the event to be given as an url parameter for the admin list of events, so you can quickly show the list
  of e.g. draft events:
  /wp-admin/admin.php?page=eme-manager&status=2
  (1: public, 2: private, 5: draft)
* The text "Required field" in the rsvp form can now be customized in the rsvp settings
* The ical location format for an event can now be customized in the ical settings
* Bugfix: eme_filters shortcode could skip a month for the month filter

= 1.7.11 (2017/01/21) =
* Allow to search for location countries too (placeholder FILTER_COUNTRIES added for the eme_filter shortcode layout)
* The shortcode eme_filterform can now also be used together with the shortcode eme_locations (using the filters FILTER_LOCS, FILTER_TOWNS, FILTER_COUNTRIES)
* Added API function eme_wordpress_search_locations, to allow you to search for locations (as eme_wordpress_search_events). See the doc
* Put js as much in the footer as possible, and defer the execution also, to speed up page rendering
* RSS pubdate was being localised and it should be RFC822 format, this has been corrected now
* The people table can now be exported, printed and searched like the events table
* The locations table has been ajaxified too
* The 'order' option in [eme_events] can now contain own columns you want to order on.
  The default is "event_start_date ASC, event_start_time ASC, event_name ASC"
* Try to remove yoast SEO headers from the special page
* The shortcode eme_if now also accepts "eq" as an alternative for "value" and "ne" as an alternative for "notvalue"
  This is more in line with the other options (lt, gt, ge, ...)

= 1.7.10 (2016/12/16) =
* Fixed #_LOCATIONIMAGETHUMBURL
* Added #_LOCATIONIMAGETHUMBURL{MyCustomSize}
* Split out mail templates in separate section, so we can easily take the option to send html mails into account and disable the
  html editor if not needed
* Fixed some location issues

= 1.7.9 (2016/12/11) =
* Offline fix

= 1.7.8 (2016/12/10) =
* Add new discount type "fixed discount per seat"
* Add offline-payment setting
* Backwards incompatibility: renamed the multibooking option eme_register_empty_seats to just register_empty_seats
  (and documented it)
* Backwards incompatibility: for a multibooking, events that use the attendance option won't store empty seats (the 'no'-answer) unless you use the option register_empty_seats=1 (default=0)
* The HTML editor is shown for many settings/templates now, more will follow after feedback
* Add extra fields for location info: address1, address2, city, state, zip, country (the old address field is now address1; the old town field is now city).

= 1.7.7 (2016/11/01) =
* Make the delete icon for events and discounts actually work again
* Add option to make captcha case insensitive
* Make notices permanently dismissable again

= 1.7.6 (2016/10/14) =
* Added eme_for shortcode, to be able to show certain html multiple times (2 values: min, max, see doc for examples)
* Bugfix: show the no-longer-allowed-to-book message again if the end-date has passed (not for multi-booking)
* Bugfix: allow 0-seats for attendance-like events again
* Bugfix: the extra attributes field for formfields was not showing the correct value when editing the formfield
* Add the possibility to send a test email via the "Send Mails" page
* Bugfix: the smtp port setting was not correctly taken into account (always resulting in port 25 being used)

= 1.7.5 (2016/09/14) =
* Client clock functionality was not working anymore
* Fix setting 'Age of unpaid pending bookings in minutes'
* Make captcha work again (although sometimes it worked ... the quirks of php session autostart I guess)

= 1.7.4 (2016/09/13) =
* Mail was not being sent after payment arrived for autoapproval

= 1.7.3 (2016/09/12) =
* Moving a registration to another event was not working anymore

* When adding a booking in the backend, don't mark it immediately as paid
* Add booking ID back to rsvp overview

= 1.7.1 (2016/09/06) =
* Small fix: make sure payments received via ipn approve the booking if auto-approve is set
* Improvents in the event overview: you can now click on pending bookings

= 1.7.0 (2016/09/06) =
* Paging events for the last day of the month failed if the next month has fewer days. E.g. if you're
  on August 31 and tried to go to the next month via event paging, it would give you October because Sept 31 doesn't exist
* Added the possibility to send mails after payment notification from payment gateway was received. You just need to set what you want in the regular mail settings page of EME.
* Added shortcode [eme_holidays], with 1 parameter: the id of the holidays list. Will return a simple html list of your holidays list
* The event listing in the backend is now ajax based, this will result in much better performance if you have many events
* Bugfix: typo: payed => paid

= 1.6.26 (2016/08/27) =
* Fix an php warning
* For sagepay the extra cost of FirstData was taken, corrected
* When automatic cleanup of bookings is activated, the payment page will now redirect back to the event
  if not yet paid and the timer passed, to avoid people to pay for bookings that are no longer in the system

= 1.6.25 (2016/08/27) =
* Localised prices can contain html entities (weird wp function ...), in e.g. text emails this is of course not desired.
* The end date selector for recurring events was not working anymore
* The function eme_wordpress_search (to be used in your search.php, see the FAQ), was not working as it should

= 1.6.23 and 1.6.24 (2016/08/18) =
* Make sure end date >= start date in the datepicker, easier if you're switching months and so ...
* Partial update for Swedish (thanks to Magnus Tamelander)
* re-added some placeholders that were not supposed to be removed
* dismissable notices were not dismissable at all ...

= 1.6.22 (2016/08/17) =
* Add email to stripe checkout form
* Fix a php warning when editing a registration
* Show lat/long in location overview, easier to detect front-end problems then if the map doesn't show the correct location
* Finally removed legacy and deprecated placeholders.
* INCOMPATIBILITY: The pattern for custom formfields is gone and replaced by a more generic attributes field
  So if you had patterns for a formfield (only possible for the datefield in fact), please re-add these

* Use dismissable admin notices, much prettier... (using a slightly adapted version of collizo4sky's persist-admin-notices-dismissal)
* Bugfix that prevented correct mails to be sent out for private events after IPN from e.g. paypal arrived

= 1.6.21 (2016/08/02) =
* Added holidays selection to the widget
* CSRF Security fix: although I already check the permissions of the persons doing this, and everything is checked afterwards,
  I now use the wordpress nonce to make sure nobody messes with the form/url contents for events/locations/... .
  Detected by Securify/Summer of Pwnage/Job Diesveld
* Remove inserted javascript from not allowed option fields (which is just
about anything, except
'eme_html_header','eme_html_footer','eme_payment_form_header_format','eme_payment_form_footer_format','eme_multipayment_form_header_format','eme_multipayment_form_footer_format')
  This is just an extra precaution, next to the CSRF fix, suggested by Securify/Summer of Pwnage/Job Diesveld
* Remove javascript from event and location format settings and templates.
  This is just an extra precaution, next to the CSRF fix, suggested by Securify/Summer of Pwnage/Job Diesveld
* Make #_ADDBOOKINGFORM_IF_NOT_REGISTERED and #_REMOVEBOOKINGFORM_IF_REGISTERED behave correctly again
* Multibooking form fix
* Booking return page was not shown correctly

= 1.6.20 (2016/07/28) =
* Bugfix in sending mails on first booking

= 1.6.19 (2016/07/28) =
* Added an option to disable the extra html paragraph tags around notes/excerpts
* Bugfix for the payment buttons (not only paypal)
* Fix a php warning for empty discounts, created because the price is now formatted to the locale in wordpress (and can thus not be an empty string, but needs to be a real floating point)

= 1.6.18 (2016/07/24) =
* You can now add/delete/edit discounts and discount groups in the backend
* Bugfix: adding bookings in the backend was not working anymore
* Small bugfix: the payment header/footer format settings were not always taken into account

= 1.6.17 (2016/07/21) =
* Allow calculated discount to be changed for bookings in the backend
* Allow dynamic price calculation in the RSVP form (using #_DYNAMICPRICE and a
setting to activate it if wanted; for multibooking this placeholder needs to
be in the header or footer section)
* Added booking placeholder #_TOTALDISCOUNT, so you can let people know how much discount they got in the end
* The price shown (mails, tables, frontend) will now be formatted according to the locale in wordpress. The number of decimals is now an option you can set in the 'Other' section of the EME settings. In the input fields you still need to use the international notation though ...
* In the template header/footer for multibooking events, you can now also use regular event placeholders. The first event in the multibooking list will be used as source. So you can now use #_LANG, #_CURRENCY, etc ...
* Add function eme_wordpress_search, makes it easier to use in your theme's search.php
* Add filter eme_calday_url_class_filter, so you can change the class for calendar day-urls yourself (e.g. for setting "noindex" or so, searchbots don't execute js so the class needs to be added via code)
* Bugfix: when showing a single event, the external url was not always taken into account

= 1.6.16 (2016/07/13) =
* Feature: coupon codes can now be case insensitive (new coupon column 'strcase' added, 1: case sensitive, 0: case insensitive)
* Small bugfix: discount groups couldn't be deleted, this has been fixed

= 1.6.15 (2016/07/12) =
* Feature: cleanup of unpaid bookings can be scheduled now, and should be working too ...
* Feature: added discounts (coupon codes) with fixed discount or a percentage, expiration date, limit number of uses, allow different discounts to be entered, (discount groups) and CSV upload of coupons and groups. See the documentation for more.
* Added placeholder #_RESPFIELD{xx}, with 'xx' being a db field property of a person (like person_id, lastname, firstname, email, phone; ... see events-manager.php, function eme_create_people_table)
* Added placeholder #_LANG, so now you can use conditional tags, check the lang and then use your own text where you want it. Since conditional tags are possible just about anywhere, this allows for true multilanguage mails, subjects, screen messages etc ...
* Added event placeholder #_NOEXCERPT, so you can show the rest of the event notes and not the excerpt itself. Together with the other 2 placeholders (#_EXCERPT and #_NOTES) this now gives you full control of what part of the notes you want to show.
* Updated Mollie API to version 1.6.0
* Added a setting to bring back the google api key for google maps, and added a separate Maps section in the options.
* Change: the automatic cleanup of unpaid bookings now works for pending bookings only, so as not to interfere with approved bookings that don't need payment
* Bugfix: when the difference in seconds was less than a day, recurrent events would happen on the same day even if they start on day 1 and end on day 2
* Bugfix: when not using permalinks and using "?lang=" in the url, the rsvp submit wasn't working for events

= 1.6.14 (2016/05/26) =
* Remove deprecated function call get_current_user
* Added filters to change the scope of the week/month/year filters to your liking: eme_week_scope_filter, eme_month_scope_filter, eme_year_scope_filter
* Added placeholders #_EVENTFIELD{xx}, #_LOCATIONFIELD{xx}, #_BOOKINGFIELD{xx} and #_ATTENDFIELD{xx} with 'xx' being the name of a field for events, locations, bookings or attendees. This way you can show any info as stored in a respective field (in the db) in your format (can easily replace a number of existing placeholders: #_ATTENDFIRSTNAME, #_ATTENDADDRESS1, #_ATTENDADDRESS2, #_ATTENDCITY, #_ATTENDSTATE, #_ATTENDZIP, #_ATTENDCOUNTRY, #_ATTENDID, #_BOOKINGID, #_RESPFIRSTNAME, #_RESPADDRESS1, #_RESPADDRESS2, #_RESPCITY, #_RESPSTATE, #_RESPZIP, #_RESPCOUNTRY, and more for events and locations.
* Allow the external url for event/location details to be used directly or not when clicking on event/location details (default: yes, the original behavior)
* Feature: added option ignore_url to shortcode eme_location, so you can choose to ignore the external url for a single event when using this shortcode
* Added an option to quote the timezone info in ICAL outputs, since some ICAL clients require that despite the RFC
* Added new shortcode eme_categories, with optional parameters event_id,
eventful, scope, template_id, template_id_header and template_id_footer
  The format understands placeholders with values like #_CATEGORYFIELD{xx}, with 'xx' being category_id, category_name, description or slug.

* Added formfield type "date" (html5 form type), together with the possibility to provide a date pattern
* Disable the possibility to convert an event to a recurrence if bookings exist for the event, otherwise those bookings would get deleted.

* Also store the ip per booking

= 1.6.12 (2016/02/26) =
* Better php session handling (and add an option to clean the session upon login/logout)

= 1.6.1 (2015/12/07) =
* Bugfix: make captcha work again

= 1.6.0 (2015/12/06) =
* Feature: you can add holidays to a recurrent list of events, in which case that day will be skipped (no event) when creating/editing the recurrence
  A list of holidays consists of 1 or more rows of the format YYYY-MM-DD
* Feature: added option weekdays to the calendar shortcode, so you can select which days of the week you want to show (0-6 as values)
* Feature: added #_CANCEL_OWN_URL rsvp shortcode, can be used in event lists so you can allow logged in people to just cancel their own booking with
           a single click, or the event owner/author
           Difference with #_CANCEL_URL is that #_CANCEL_URL gives the url no matter what (easier for mails, not wp-members and such)
* Feature: added shortcode [eme_attendees_report_link], generating a csv for the attendees/events (events as rows, dates as columns, attendees as cell entries)
  Options: - event_template_id (if not given, format is "#_EVENTNAME #_STARTTIME")

           - scope (the scope of events to return, if not given, scope=this_month)

           - title (title of the link, if not given: "Attendees CSV")

* Improvement: 'Bookings for' was not translated in the printable view
* Improvement: added partial Hungarian translation, thanks to Márton Jakobey
* Improvement: for attendance types, if the min. number of seats to book is 1 (so attendance is required), then the yes/no field is now hidden (not for multibookings yet)
* Improvement: some layout improvements when creating events (concerning the date/time and recurrent info)
* Bugfix: firstname was not detected as an 'ok' field if it was required and WP membership was required too. Since the value
  is then readonly, we can ignore the required check then anyway ...
* Bugfix: for multiprice events, the multibooking form was not rendered because the count of required fields in the formats was wrong

= 1.5.53 (2015/11/17) =
* Feature: added filters eme_cal_full_yearmonth and eme_cal_small_yearmonth, so you can change the header shown in the full/small calendar

= 1.5.52 (2015/11/16) =

  contact_body,contact_cancelled_body,contact_pending_body
  contact_subject,contact_cancelled_subject,contact_pending_subject

= 1.5.48 (2015/09/26) =
* Feature: you can now move a booking to another event (when updating the booking)

= 1.5.47 (2015/09/23) =
* Feature: added event placeholder #_SINGLE_EVENTPAGE_EVENTID, returns the event id of the single event page currently shown

* Bugfix: the countdown and HOURS/DAYS_TILL_START/END were reversed (negative values shown)

= 1.5.43 (2015/09/09) =
* Improvement: German language updates, thanks to Joerg Knoerchen
* Bugfix: take into account wordpress weirdness when setting UTC-like timezones in the preferences ...

* Improvement: small visual improvement when showing the username in the registration overview
* Improvement: also show the CSV export link if there are just pending seats (not approved)

* Bugfix: when showing the booking form, no check was made whether or not enough seats were available in the case of multiprice with a defined multi-minimum too
* Bugfix: make sure all #_*SPACES placeholders return a number for multi-price values (wasn't the case if the value should be 0)
* Bugfix: replace possible multibooking placeholders in the payment return page too

= 1.5.41 (2015/7/27) =
* Feature: added placeholder #_EVENTCATEGORIES_CSS, returning a space-separated list of categories.

* Feature: add the option to ignore paypal tax setting in your profile

* Bugfix: the booker firstname/lastname was not correctly replaced in the cancel form for WP users

= 1.5.40 (2015/05/31) =

  $booker = eme_get_person_by_post();
  if (!empty($booker)) {
     $already_registered=1;
  }
* Feature: now everybody can cancel a booking (even non-wp users) via a special link. Cancel urls in mails and user profile use these links now.
           The old booking cancel form will be deprecated in the future, as using this link/form is more secure and easier to maintain
           For this #_CANCEL_LINK and #_CANCEL_URL have been adapted already. And a new placeholder #_CANCEL_CODE has been added that
           returns the cancel code to be used in the new cancel booking form (to be implemented)
* Feature: added option ignore_url to shortcode eme_event: in a number of cases (like when using this shortcode in the calendar format for an event entry), the url would case the page to be redirected. Using this, you can ignore that url.

= 1.5.29 =
* Feature: allow 2Checkout sandbox/test/live modes
* Feature: added Sage Pay payment gateway
* Feature: attempt to make the map sizes responsive: width and height can be "%" too, for responsiveness: width should be 100%
* Feature: added conditional booking placeholder #_IS_MULTIBOOKING again, only returns 1 when actually doing a multi-booking, not when updating/deleting a booking
* Feature: extra info can be requested for a person: #_LASTNAME (= #_NAME), #_FIRSTNAME, #_ADDRESS1, #_ADDRESS2, #_CITY, #_STATE, #_ZIP, #_COUNTRY
           also the corresponding booking placeholders are there: #_RESPLASTNAME (= #_RESPNAME), #_RESPFIRSTNAME, ...

* Feature: added conditional event placeholders #_IS_AUTHOR, #_IS_CONTACTPERSON and #_IS_AUTHOR_OR_CONTACTPERSON

* Improvement: German language updates, thanks to Joerg Knoerchen
* Improvement: autocomplete person info (based on name) when adding new registrations in the backend

= 1.5.26 =
* Feature: added location placeholders #_EDITLOCATIONLINK and #_EDITLOCATIONURL

* Bugfix: the 'no events message' was not always being shown
* Bugfix: fix the double headers-options in EME settings (tab 'Other')
* Bugfix: datapicker was not being added in the front end (for the monthly filter)
* Bugfix: load google js via https when needed

* Feature: added the possibility to add a Bcc address to all outgoing mails

* Removed old Google Checkout

= 1.5.23 =
* Bugfix: make client clock checking work again for the calendar
* Improvement: optimize the inclusion of javascript files the way wordpress likes it most

= 1.5.22 =
* Bugfix: another function rename that came back to haunt me is fixed

= 1.5.21 =
* Bugfix: make #_BOOKINGS work again (typo fix)

= 1.5.20 =
* Feature: added shortcode eme_mybookings with as optional arguments a
template_id for header, content and footer, and an option to show future or all bookings
  [eme_mybookings template_id=3 template_id_header=7 template_id_footer=9 future=0]
  [eme_mybookings template_id=3 future=1]
  Will show all bookings for the logged in user, based on the layout given by the templates or by the generic booking list format
  Also added booking placeholders #_CANCEL_LINK and #_CANCEL_URL, so you can create a link to cancel 1 specific booking too (for future events only)
  Also: the list of future bookings made is now in the user's profile, with an cancel link
* Feature: you can now also change the text above/below the payment buttons for a multi-booking form
* Feature: added filters eme_eval_booking_form_post_filter and eme_eval_multibooking_form_post_filter, which happen just after the POST of the booking form
  (1 arg: $event for eme_eval_booking_form_post_filter, or $events of eme_eval_multibooking_form_post_filter; containing the event(s) details that are being booked for). The filter eme_eval_booking_form_post_filter differs from eme_eval_booking_form_filter in this sense that this filter happens immediately after the POST, while eme_eval_booking_form_filter happens after the booker has been created already (which is a bit stupid).
* Feature: added option no_events_message to the shortcode eme_events, so you can adjust the text when there're no events per shortcode usage if wanted
* Feature: the CSV separator can now be changed in the 'Other' section of the EME settings
* Bugfix: sometimes when multiple maps were shown (and dependant on the OS used), even multiple calls to microtime() return the same value
          so as a result some javascript variables had the same name and thus the maps might show the same address
          This is now fixed by adding a rand() call to the variable names
* Bugfix: required formfields that were defined as dropdown were not allowed to post "0" as a return value for required fields
* Bugfix: fix some firstdata issues, thanks to ecoyork

* Change: renamed function eme_event_category_url to eme_category_url
* Change: removed #_IS_MULTIBOOKING placeholder, was not working correctly
* Improvement: when using custom fields in a form, FIELD{03} and FIELD{3} (thus leading zero's) are now supported. This was already working ok for storing the values, but not for checking the required field values
* Improvement: when clicking on a calendar day in the small calendar and there's only one event where the external url is set, we now redirect to that url
* Improvement: #_PHONE and #_COMMENT can now also be used in header/footer parts in a multibooking form
* Improvement: German language updates, thanks to Joerg Knoerchen
* Improvement: Dutch language updates, thanks to Herman Boswijk

= 1.5.19 =
* Feature: rsvp end date/time restriction can now be negative, so you can say "Allow RSVP until -2 days -1 hours before the event starts, indicating the rsvp can go on for 2 days and 1 hour AFTER the event has started. The rsvp end can never go beyond the event end date itself of course.
* Feature: new scope for events: 'ongoing': only shows ongoing events, for this we try to use the date and time, but it might be incorrect since there's no user timezone info

* Feature: added placeholders #_APPROVEDSPACES and #_APPROVEDSPACES{xx} (see the doc)
* Feature: added option eme_register_empty_seats to the shortcode eme_add_multibooking_form: by default it is 0, but if you want to register 0-seats too, set this to 1
* Feature: an event can now also be designated to take attendances only for bookings, a corresponding conditional tag #_IS_ATTENDANCE has been created as well so you can change messages shown or emails sent
* Bugfix: the required fields were not being checked in the backend, so browsers not supporting the html5-required tag could input empty custom field info
* Bugfix: take booking price=0 into account for events that still have a payment gateway configured
* Bugfix: make simple event paging work again
* Improvement: German language updates, thanks to Joerg Knoerchen

= 1.5.18 =
* Feature: added action eme_delete_recurrence_action
* Feature: allow custom fields also in the header/footer for multi-booking format templates, but use with care: will only work correctly for 'identical' events (events with the same custom fields)
* Feature: support polylang, but only if the setting 'The language is set from content' is choosen
* Feature: added filter eme_events_format_prefilter, a initial filter for the events format, in case people want to change anything before the placeholders get replaced. Has 2 arguments: $format and $event
* Feature: added placeholder #_LOCALE, returning the currently chosen locale. Can be used in multilanguage setups, so you can change content of anything inside an event, location or form based on the locale active at that time (if no language tags are provided by the language plugin you're using)
* Improvement: support custom translations files in wp-content/languages/ (WP_LANG_DIR setting), so changed translation files are not overwritten when updating EME
* Bugfix: #_RSVPEND was incorrect
* Bugfix: if the period was "daily" in the list widget and 2 events were on the same day but a different month, the new month info wasn't shown, making it look as the second event happened in the same month as the first
* Bugfix: translation url fixes
* Bugfix: recurrence defined as "start day" was not working ok
* Code change: small code change to make multi-bookings more wordpress 404-proof

= 1.5.17 =
* Bugfix: #_RSVPEND was incorrect

= 1.5.16 =
* Improvement: each category now also has a SEO slug (albeit not editable yet)
* Incompatibility: the function eme_event_category_url now takes the whole category array as argument (as for events and locations)
* Incompatibility: the function eme_get_event_categories now returns an assoc array of categories, the old behaviour is renamed to a new function eme_get_event_category_names 
* Bugfix: make sure the booking cancel form work again

= 1.5.15 =
* Improvement: allow username/email to be changed when doing a new registration via the backend and WP membership is required for an event
* Bugfix: the new filters eme_rsvp_email_body_text_filter and eme_rsvp_email_body_html_filter were not taken into account (missing underscore)
* Bugfix: the end date/time placeholder #@[a-z] were being replaced correctly, but the '@' remained too

= 1.5.14 =
* Bugfix: make sure initial date for new events and recurrences is the current date, not 1970 ...

= 1.5.13 =
* Bugfix: for events with no defined contact person, I tried to get the admin email but used a multisite function for it (which doesn't seem to be defined if you don't activate multisite)
* Bugfix: fix sending of mail for normal registrations (typo fixes)

= 1.5.12 =

= 1.5.10 =
* Feature: support qtranslate plus, next to qtranslate and mqtranslate
* Feature: added new filters eme_rsvp_email_body_text_filter and eme_rsvp_email_body_html_filter to be able to change the mail body just before it is sent
* Incompatibility: removed the per-user date format settings, was getting too confusing for coding up different formats for backend and frontend date formatting, while the generic WP settings should be used anyway
* Incompatibility: renamed eme_email_filter to eme_email_obfuscate_filter
* Improvement: try to use admin info when no other contact info is present for an event (can happen after using the frontent submit form)
* Bugfix: better use of function strtotime to take Daylight Saving Time into account (not all days have 24 hours)
* Bugfix: there's a bug for the cancel-mails and placeholders due to the fact that I first delete the booking before sending the mail (otherwise the number of free seats in the mail can be wrong), but because of that the placeholders can't be replaced anymore since the booking no longer exists. This has been fixed by getting the booking info before doing anything and handing that info to the function that does the mail sending (and not letting that function get the booking info anymore, since it might already been deleted)

= 1.5.9 =
